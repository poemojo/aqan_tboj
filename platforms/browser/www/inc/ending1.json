      "Amabo kept both pistols raised, his whole body tense as he did some quick thinking. The Blade was the job, but if he was right, Strum might be too dangerous to let live. If the Blade could prove his claims, Strum's head might even fetch a big price from the right people.",
      "From what Karrab could see of this secret Base alone, the Blade's accusations seemed not only possible but highly probable. This vigilante's reward money was chump change compared to what Strum's criminal rivals would pay for his corpse. Hell, a skilled vigilante could be very useful asset to have.",
      "Amabo lowered the gun he had on the Blade of Justice. He nodded to the vigilante, and directed his full attention to Strum. The crime lord cursed and made to lunge at the Blade, but Amabo expertly shot him in the left knee. Derek Strum fell hard as the Blade agilely swept in and decapitated the criminal kingpin. And just like that the job was done.",
      "\"What is your name, citizen?\" asked the masked man as he slung the blood from his grotesque bladed-blade.",
      "\"Amabo, Amabo Karrab,\" replied Amabo.",
      "\"Well listen... thanks Amabo.\""
