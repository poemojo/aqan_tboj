      "Amabo kept both his pistols raised, his whole body tense, as he did some quick thinking. The job was to bring the Blade in. The vigilante was clearly unstable, he'd already killed three people. It just wasn't worth tossing the paycheck on the word of a mad man.",
      "Amabo had wake-up calls to pay for and back rent due. Crazy, or not, the bounty for this Blade of Justice character would pay the bills and then some. Not to mention the most influential crime boss of the city would be a good friend to have.",
      "Amabo pointed both of his handguns at the vigilante. \"I'm collecting your bounty, sport!\"",
      "The Blade reached for his obscene Bladed Blade, but Amabo cut him to the chase and put two rounds in his right shoulder. The Blade grunted in pain, but still chose to bull rush Amabo. The bounty hunter shot another two rounds into the vigilante's knees. His mark fell to the ground as he cried out. Derek Strum calmly walked to his prone nemesis and delivered him a swift kick in the head, knocking him out cold. The criminal kingpin delivered five or six savage blows to his chest and stomach for good measure. Then, calm once more, he straightened out his suit and approached Amabo.",
      "\"What's your name, kid?\" asked Derek Strum.",
      "\"Amabo, Amabo Karrab,\" replied the bounty hunter.",
      "\"Well... Thanks Amabo.\""
