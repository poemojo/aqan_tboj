      "Amabo decided heâ€™d start his hunt for the rogue vigilante, the Blade of Justice, in the warehouse district. As he moved towards the outer wall of the city the wealth and regality of Riverside became less and less evident. Eventually he found himself surrounded by plain rectangular buildings, and knew that he had arrived. He immediately spotted signs of a struggle. There was a large pile of damaged crates and a great deal of blood around Warehouse 202. There seemed to also be an broken window in the guard box of the same warehouse. The amount of property damage in evidence was obscene, clearly this Blade character was not kidding around.",
      "\"You just had to accept this warrant... Thanks Amabo...\" the bounty hunter said to himself.",
      "Amabo knew this warehouse held goods for a shipping concern in the city, the docks seemed like a likely next place to investigate, but perhaps there were other clues to be found here at the warehouse."
