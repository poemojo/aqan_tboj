      "Amabo decided he’d start his hunt for the rogue vigilante, the Blade of Justice, in the warehouse district. As he moved towards the outer wall of the city the wealth and regality of Riverside became less and less evident. Eventually he found himself surrounded by plain rectangular buildings, and knew that he had arrived. He immediately spotted signs of a struggle. There was a large pile of damaged crates and a great deal of blood around Warehouse 202. There seemed to also be an broken window in the guard box of the same warehouse. The amount of property damage in evidence was obscene, clearly this Blade character was not kidding around.",
      "&quot;You just had to accept this warrant... Thanks Amabo...&quot; the bounty hunter said to himself.",
      "Amabo knew this warehouse held goods for a shipping concern in the city, the docks seemed like a likely next place to investigate, but perhaps there were other clues to be found here at the warehouse."

The wealth of this city hardly seemed to reach the perimeter. Upon entering the docks Amabo immediately discovered signs of another struggle, and old barge tethered at the the far end of the docks showed signs of extensive damage. Amabo snuck aboard, finding crates strewn about the deck, many of them had been broken into revealing caches of illegal drugs. Amabo debated pocketing some of them for later use, but decided against it. Amabo knew that this barge was owned by the local crime boss, Derek Strum, and it was thus obvious that the vigilante was looking to put Mr. Strum out of business.",

      "He cast about the steadily rolling deck and thought he saw a glint of steel beneath one of the crates, but he could have been mistaken. Amabo also spotted a deckhand cleaning up the mess, this was probably a good time to do some interrogation."
